# hello

Welcome to your new hello project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with hello, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd hello/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor


## Setup

### Requirements:

- Windows 10 or higher (version 2004 or higher). Build 19041.xxx or higher.
- 64-bit machine (System type x64 based PC)


### Steps for setup:

#### WSL:

- Find the Windows PowerShell in your Start menu and run it as the Administrator.
- WSL is the Windows Subsystem for Linux and it will allow us to run command line commands in Windows. Here’s more info from Microsoft: ​​https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
- Run command into PowerShell: wsl --install
- Once that’s done, you’ll need to restart your computer.
- Upon restart you will be prompted to setup an ubuntu username and password and then you will have successfully installed WSL. (Keep a note of both of these pieces of information, you’ll need it later on).
- To confirm that everything worked correctly, type the following command into PowerShell: wsl --list --verbose
- You should see ubuntu version.
